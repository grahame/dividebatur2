dividebatur2: process single-transferable-vote elections

Currently supports the following STV election types:

 - Australian Senate under the Commonwealth Electoral Act (1918) (post 2015 voting reforms)

dividebatur2 is a work-in-progress, porting [dividebatur](https://github.com/grahame/dividebatur) to the Rust 
programming language. If you're after something more mature, check this out. The primary motivation for the
rewrite is improvements in performance, and in correctness and maintainability. dividebatur2 is currently
clocking in ~ 15x faster than the original Python implementation.

For a high level overview of what this does, check this blog post:

For the legislation defining the system we are implementing, see the `legislation` directory of the repository.
The counting algorithm is defined in Section 273. Other sections define the rules around formality of ballots.
